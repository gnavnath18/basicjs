execution contex of js 
two phases global ec and functional ec 
in start initalised global ec in this 
then we move to local scope functional scope 
then we take all variables and store in stack with undefined 
if function is there we store with its definition 

eg 
let a=10 
let b=29
function addTwo(){
    let c=f+g 
    return c 
}

global-this

2. memory ec 
a-undefined 
b-undefined 
addTwo - let c=f+g 
    return c

3. execution contex 
a=10
b=29
